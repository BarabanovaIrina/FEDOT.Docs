## Repository Guidelines
 
## The basic principles of the FEDOT and FEDOT.Algs repositories are as follows:
* Keep up to the Python code style recommended by PEP8;
* Implement unit tests when new functionality is added;
* Maintain API compatibility for changes in the kernel;
* Enhancements to the source code should be made using pull requests;
* Suggestions for new functionality can be made using new issues.
 
## You should also use the repository using the following practices:
